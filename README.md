# YouLoad #

Very simple YouTube playlist downloader (using pytube library).
(Perhaps this will become a more useful GUI application later.)


Please note the list item format: that should look like [Playlist(your_link), Playlist(your_link_1)]

I didn't aim to put here all the existing formats that are possible to get from YouTube, you can experiment on your own.
